# Ken's Deeply Complex Balsamic Dressing
My hand-crafted, open-source, salad dressing recipe. It's a simply complex blend of
flavors resulting in an overall fantastic mix bringing romaine, spinach, and kale to life.

# List of Ingredients
- Olive Oil - 3 tbl
- Balsamic Vinegar - 2 tbl
- Honey - 1 tbl
- Dijon Mustard - 2 tsp
- Garlic Clove - 1
- Parmesan Cheese, Grated - 2 tbl

# Directions
Put all ingredients in an electric food processor. Pulse to fully blend.
I've found this dressing best matches up with a hearty salad consisting of one or more:
- Romaine
- Spinach
- Parsley
- Lacinto Kale

# History
I've been working this salad dressing recipe for most of 2015. Started off with a
traditional base of oil and vinegar. Olive and balsamic. Decided to punch it up a little
by adding a few cloves of garlic. Decided it was too harsh and made my teammates avoid me
at work the next day.

Some time along the way I caught a taste of honey as a natural sweetener mellowing the
bitterness of garlic. Tuned down to a single clove for balance.

Considering the recipe I eventually brought in shredded parmesan to add a salty element
for an overall rich taste. Thickened it nicely too.

Finally added a touch of Dijon to add a classy depth. This is what you'll encounter when
you make this recipe.

I hope you enjoy it, and I bid you peace.
